# Myocardial-Infarction
In this project, I used logistic regression to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not. Heart disease is a common and serious condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection of heart disease is crucial for timely treatment and prevention of adverse health outcomes.

To develop the model, I used a dataset containing information about patients, including age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and other factors. The dataset included both patients with heart disease and those without, making it ideal for a binary classification problem.

After cleaning and preprocessing the data, I split it into training and testing sets. Then I used logistic regression, a machine learning algorithm, to fit the training data and predict the test data.

I evaluated the performance of the model using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. I also used a confusion matrix to visualize the model's performance in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

The results showed that the logistic regression model had high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model was able to predict whether a patient had heart disease with a high degree of accuracy, demonstrating the potential of using machine learning for early detection of heart disease.
